I SURVIVED SINATRA! But… barely. So, when it came to Rails, I put in my everything. A couple of situations changed during my project week that caused me to take a couple of days off coding. But, lets focus on Rails.
I needed to create a Rails app, and I needed to meet the following parameters:
A user can log in
A user can log in with through another service provider (e.g., Github)
A user can see an index page with their own and other users’ items
A user can update or delete their own items or add things to them, but can view another user’s items and add their own and other users’ items to their favorites
If the user is not logged in, they can view the index page and view details of the items in the index page, but they will not be able to perform other actions without logging in
Based on the parameters above, I decided that I would create a recipe app in Rails. To create a Rails app, follow RubyDocs or you can reference the Flatiron School learn.co readme.
Begin!
