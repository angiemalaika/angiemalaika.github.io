My 11-year-old niece, Thembi, started 8th grade this January, after skipping two grades. You get to know Thembi’s personality when you realize she has a remarkable ability to ask a question and then keep digging until… well, usually until you say, “ I don’t know”. My new approach to Thembi’s “I want to know everything”, personality is, instead of saying “I don’t know” (when I actually don’t know), I tell her, “let’s find out” or “I’ll have to find out more about that”.
